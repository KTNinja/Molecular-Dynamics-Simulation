# Molecular-Dynamics-Simulation
This Program calculates the state of particles in a system.
The md_LJ_fluid.inp file is the input file from which we get all the data required. 
We equilibrated the system for about 500 units of time by resetting the velocity to a Gaussian distribution after every 5 units of time and also imposed periodic boundary conditions. The main file is the main working file and the module_14 contains the helper code for running the main file. The outputs are also uploaded for reference.
